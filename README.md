# Code Gym
This repo is dedicated to sharpening up programming skills and experimentation. The code in this repo is not production code, but feel free to poke around and even try some of the assignments.

## Leetcode 75
https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/
The Leetcode 75 study plan are a collection of small assignments that I'm using to practise my Java skills with and also to learn more of the advanced Java features I've not yet been able to play with while writing production code. My code so far is here: https://github.com/seanradley/codeGym/tree/master/src/main/java/leetcode75

## Java 21, Java 17, Java 11 and Advanced Java 8
This course teaches the post version 8 features of Java. I'm picking up some new techniques and tricks from here. I'm not implementing every assignment, but do so as needed. Code here: https://github.com/seanradley/codeGym/tree/master/src/main/java/com/udemy/java21_17_11_8

## My own ideas
The section is for implementing my own problems and wondering aloud. Code here: https://github.com/seanradley/codeGym/tree/master/src/main/java/org/example

## String Kata
I've alsways been fond of implementing Osherov's String Calculator Kata and I recommend it.
Osherov's String Calcultator Kata: https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1
